Hello!

For this project I will be creating my first project for The Odin Project.
This will be a simple project consisting of creating a recipe website with a main index page
that will have links to several recipes.

Once I have complete this project I will have demonstrated my competence in basic HTML webpage creation and formatting including HTML boiler plate creation, use of open and close tags, relative and absolute linking via anchor elements, image embedding, lists, nesting, use of Git and Git Hub, and formatting best practices.

Thank you for visiting!
