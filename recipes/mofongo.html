        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            Mofongo might not look like much, but it sure is tasty. This traditional Puerto Rican dish is made with mashed green plantains with garlic, olive oil and pork rinds (or bacon). Mofongo goes well with chicken or fish broth and can be stuffed with garlic shrimp, carne frita or octopus salad. It can also be formed into small balls and dropped in soups or served directly in a mortar. This is one of my many guilty pleasures!
        </p>

            You can make this version of the dish with a food processor, but for even more authentic flavor, use a pilón, or a wooden mortar and pestle.
