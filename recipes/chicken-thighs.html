        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Ok, folks!  One of the questions I get asked most often is how to cook chicken thighs.  They're so easy to make, and this has become one of my most popular recipes! </p>
        <p>I think people love the thigh meat because it's super flavorful, but they just aren't as familiar with cooking them as they are the breast meat.  Luckily, it's an incredibly easy process that takes only a few minutes of prep and then the thighs bake up to crispy tender perfection on a sheet pan.</p>
