        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Ok, folks!  One of the questions I get asked most often is how to cook chicken thighs.  They're so easy to make, and this has become one of my most popular recipes! </p>
        <p>I think people love the thigh meat because it's super flavorful, but they just aren't as familiar with cooking them as they are the breast meat.  Luckily, it's an incredibly easy process that takes only a few minutes of prep and then the thighs bake up to crispy tender perfection on a sheet pan.</p>

        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>3 pounds of chicken thighs, about 6-8</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons salt</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons onion powder</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons Italian seasoning</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon black pepper</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Line a large baking sheet with foil for easy cleanup and set aside.</li>
            <li>Remove the chicken thighs from their packaging and pat them dry with paper towels. Arrange the chicken thighs on prepared baking sheet and drizzle with the olive oil rubbing the oil into the chicken to coat.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl mix together the salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, Italian seasoning, and paprika.  Sprinkle the spices over the chicken evenly.</li>
            <li>Bake chicken in preheated oven for 35-45 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
